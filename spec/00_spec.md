## The Onion Pay Stream (TOPS)
`"Secure payments for onion-routed bandwidth"`


### Problem Case: 
Incentivizing Private and Trustless Bandwidth Payments in Tor

<b>Background</b>

Tor relays (especially exit relays) play a critical role in providing bandwidth for private communication. However, running a relay incurs operational costs (e.g., bandwidth, hardware, and energy). While donations and altruistic contributions sustain much of the Tor network, they are insufficient to incentivize widespread adoption of high-performance relays, particularly in regions with limited resources.

<b>Trustless Bandwidth Payment Challenges</b>

1. Trust Issues:
    - For Clients: Clients risk paying upfront for a service that a relay might not fully provide (e.g., poor bandwidth or early termination of the circuit).
    - For Relays: Relays risk routing traffic for clients who refuse to pay after receiving the service.
2. Anonymity and Privacy:
    - The protocol must ensure that neither the client's nor the relay's identity is exposed during the payment process.
    - Payments should not compromise the unlinkability of circuits, a fundamental property of Tor.
3. Asymmetric Accountability:
    - Relays cannot really blacklist misbehaving clients, as client IP addresses are hidden.
    - Clients, on the other hand, can blacklist poorly performing relays more directly by identifying their onion service or IP address.
4. Incremental Payments:
    - Large upfront payments discourage usage due to high trust requirements.
    - A pay-per-use model is more suitable for dynamic bandwidth usage but is difficult to enforce trustlessly.
5. Scalability:
    - The solution must scale across a decentralized network without adding excessive computational or bandwidth overhead.

### Proposed Solution: The Onion Pay Stream

"The Onion Pay Stream" (TOPS) addresses these challenges by introducing a trust-minimized, privacy-preserving protocol that integrates incremental payment streams into Tor circuits. 

<b>Use Case Example:</b>

A client wants to establish a Tor circuit for 10 minutes of browsing and is willing to pay 10 sats for this service.
Current Risks:
- Client Risk: If the client pays upfront, the relay could provide subpar bandwidth or terminate the connection early.
- Relay Risk: If the client pays only at the end, they may disconnect without paying.

Privacy Constraints:

- Payments must be conducted in a way that preserves Tor’s anonymity guarantees (blinded paths).
- Relays and clients cannot directly associate payments with real-world identities.

Key Requirements

1. Trustless Payment Mechanism:
    - Both parties should have limited risk exposure.
    - Payment should be incremental, matching the service provided.
2. Privacy-Preserving:
    - The payment process must not compromise the anonymity of either the client or the relay.
3. Dispute Minimization:
    - The protocol should inherently reduce the possibility of disputes by structuring payments in small increments tied to service performance.
4. Efficiency:
    - The payment process must not introduce significant latency or overhead into Tor’s operation.




## Detailed Breakdown of the "The Onion Pay Stream" Solution

"The Onion Pay Stream" or "TOPS" introduces a trust-minimized, incremental payment protocol for bandwidth usage in the Tor network. This solution ensures both clients and relays are incentivized to act honestly, while maintaining the privacy guarantees that Tor provides.

### (1) Key Features of Onion Pay Stream
1. Incremental Payments:
    - Payments are divided into small rounds (e.g., 1 sat per minute) to reduce risk for both parties.
    - The first round has an optional `handshake fee` but can be free to allow clients to evaluate performance without upfront risk. Noobie relays might want to make it free, while mature relays may want to charge a fee after they establish a reputation for providing high bandwidth. 
2. Privacy-Preserving:
    - Uses BOLT12 offers (blinded paths) to ensure that payments are unlinkable and do not compromise the anonymity of either the client or the relay.
3. Trust-Minimized:
    - Payments are made after each service round, ensuring clients pay only for the bandwidth they consume.
    - Relays are incentivized to perform well to receive subsequent payments.
4. Scalable and Efficient:
    - Requires minimal changes to Tor’s circuit-building process.
    - Payment operations are lightweight, leveraging the existing Lightning Network infrastructure.

### (2) How It Works
Phase 1: Circuit Establishment
1. Relay Shares Payment Terms:
    - During the Tor circuit negotiation, the relay advertises its payment requirements (e.g., 1 sat per minute for 10 minutes, first minute free) using a static BOLT12 offer or a similar descriptor.
2. Client Sends Payment Intent:
    - The client acknowledges the relay's terms by sending a unique payment id hash (generated locally) agreeing to use the relay’s static offer.
3. Handshake in Onion Message:
    - A handshake onion message is sent from the client to each relay via an onion message in the respective hops. Hop 1 being an Entry Guard, hop 2 being a middle Relay and hop N being an Exit Node. No relay can read another relays onion message because each message is encrypted to the repective hop. 
4. Finally the Circuit is built and the relays begin providing service.

Phase 2: Incremental Payments
1. At the End of Each Round:
    - The relay waits for payment for the previous round *(out of band via eltord).
    - The client generates a Lightning payment for the agreed amount (e.g., 1 sat) and sends it using the Lightning Network.
2. Payment Verification:
    - The relay queries its own Lightning node to verify the payment.
    - If the payment is valid, the relay continues providing service.
    - If the payment is not receieve in the time window, then the relay kills the circuit. 
3. Final Round Payment:
    - After the last round payment then kill the circuit.

Phase 3: Circuit Termination
1. If Payment Fails:
    - If the client fails to pay, the relay terminates the circuit.
2. If Service Fails:
    - If the relay fails to provide service, the client can disconnect and stop payments.

### (3) Key Protocol Components

a. Preimages and Payment Hashes

- The client pre-generates a unique payment id hash. Using a payment id hash instead of a payment hash ensures the protocol works with both
BOLT 12 and BOLT 11 (with blinded paths), since some implementations of BOLT 12 (phoenixd) do not expose endpoints to create a `lni` invoice from the static BOLT 12 offer.
- This hash is sent to the relay (via an onion message) during circuit establishment. This is the primary key that the relay uses to verify the client has paid.

b. Payment Rounds

- The relay generates invoices for each payment hash (automatically using BOLT12 offers) and uses the Lightning Network to receive payments.

c. Privacy Guarantees

- Blinded paths in BOLT 12 (and some implementations via BOLT 11 like LND ) ensures payments are unlinkable to specific circuits or clients.
- The preimages, payment hashes and hashed payment id do not reveal client identities.

### (4) Implementation Details
Client-Side

1. Generate Payment ID Hash:
- Before building the circuit.
- Example:
```
const preimage = crypto.randomBytes(32);
const paymentIdHash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(preimage).digest('hex');
```
2. Send Payment ID Hash:
    - Add the payment id hash to the CREATE2 or EXTEND2 cells during the circuit setup.
3. Make Incremental Payments:
    - Use the Lightning Network to pay invoices incrementally.

Relay-Side

1. Advertise Payment Terms:
    - Include payment terms in the EXTENDED2 cell response during circuit setup.
    - Example Terms:
        First minute: Free.
        Subsequent rounds: 1 sat per minute.
2. Verify Payments:
    - Use the paymentHashId to match that the payment for each round are received via the Lightning Network in the message field of the BOLT12 offer.

### (5) Example Payment Schedule
```
Round	Cost (sats)	    Action
1	    Free	     Test bandwidth.
2	     1	         First payment.
3	     1	         Second payment.
...	   ..........   ..............
10	     1	         Final payment.
```

### (6) Benefits of Onion Pay Stream
For Clients

1. No Upfront Risk:
    - The free first round ensures clients don’t pay for subpar service.
2. Incremental Payments:
    - Clients only pay for the bandwidth they consume.
3. Privacy Protection:
    - Payments are unlinkable and preserve anonymity.

For Relays

1. Incentivized Bandwidth:
    - Relays earn incremental payments for good service.
2. Minimal Risk:
    - Relays can terminate service if payments are not received.


### (7) Model 

Here is a model of TOPS rounds. Any given round can be terminated if either party cheats.
```
1    ->  Free (or handshake fee)
2    ->  1 sat
3    ->  1 sat
4    ->  1 sat
5    ->  1 sat
6    ->  1 sat
7    ->  1 sat
8    ->  1 sat
9    ->  1 sat
10   ->  1 sat
```
