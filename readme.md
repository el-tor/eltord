eltor
=====

`eltor` boots up the tor network fork. It also manages paid relays and communicates with your configured lightning node. 

**‚ö° New: Library Support**
Eltord can now be used both as a standalone binary and as a library in other Rust projects! See [LIBRARY_USAGE.md](./docs/LIBRARY_USAGE.md) for details.

**üéõÔ∏è Process Management**
Eltord now includes a process manager for external applications. See the [manager example](./examples/manager.rs) for controlling eltord from external applications.

## Usage

### As a Binary

```bash
# Run as client (default)
cargo run client

# Run as relay 
cargo run

# Run with custom torrc file
cargo run client -f torrc.client.dev -pw password1234_
```

### As a Library
```rust
use eltor::{init_and_run, start_client, start_relay};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
   // 1. Setup global logger configuration
    env_logger::Builder::from_default_env()
        .target(env_logger::Target::Stdout)
        .filter_level(log::LevelFilter::Info)
        .format_timestamp_secs()
        .write_style(env_logger::WriteStyle::Always)
        .init();

    // Set args for relay, like where to find the torrc file
    println!("\n--- Running both Client+Relay flow ---");
    let both_args = vec![
        "eltord".to_string(),
        "both".to_string(),
        "-f".to_string(),
        "torrc.relay.prod".to_string(),
        "-pw".to_string(),
        "password1234_".to_string(),
    ];

    // Start eltord as both client and relay
    run_with_args(both_args).await;
}
```

See the [examples/](./examples/) directory for complete usage examples.

Spec
----
- [(00) - El Tor Spec](./spec/00_spec.md)
- [(01) - Paid Circuit Protocol](./spec/01_paid_circuits.md)


eltor is very similar to how `tor` and `torrc` works. All of the same settings can be used in the `torrc` with these additional settings:

Config
------
`torrc`
```sh
### Client Settings ###

## Lightning node settings

PaymentLightningNodeConfig type=phoenixd url=http://url.com password=pass1234 default=true
PaymentLightningNodeConfig type=lnd url=http://lnd.com macaroon=mac1234

# Max amount in msats you are willing to pay for tor circuit
PaymentCircuitMaxFee 11000


### Relay Settings ###

# Static lightning offer code
PaymentBolt12Offer lno***

# BIP-353 name that uses DNS to map to a BOLT 12 offer
PaymentBolt12Bip353 name@domain.com

# Rate the relays charges in msats per payment interval (default=1000)
PaymentRateMsats 1000

# Seconds per each payment interval (default=60)
PaymentInterval 60

# How many rounds of payments before the circuit is killed (default=10). max is 10 due to limits on data we can pass in a tor onion cell.
PaymentInvervalRounds 10

# The DNS resolver that the exit node uses (useful to signal to clients if you use a specific DNS resolver, like family.dns.mullvad.net 194.242.2.6) *Optional
DnsResolver 1.1.1.1


# We recommend to set this 0 to allow the client to test the bandwidth. 
# Setting this might make your relay less desirable as a noobie relay, but can be useful if you are being spammed or are a mature relay
HandshakeFee 0 

# A quota set in KBytes on how much bandwidth a client can use per payment interval. *future work, not being implemented yet (default=0) unlimited
BandwidthQuota 0

# Eventually support BOLT 11 because some implementations support blinded paths!
PaymentBolt11Lnurl lnurl*** 
PaymentBolt11LightningAddress name@domain.com
```

Run
---
```sh
### Run just the relay with no settings
cargo build
cargo run

### Other ways to run
# 1. Run the Relay or Client
cargo run relay
cargo run client

# 2. Relay or Client with args*
# *(pw is ControlPort clear password (not hashed))
cargo run client -f torrc.client.dev -pw password1234_
cargo run relay -f torrc.relay.dev -pw password1234_

# 3. Relay or Client with env vars*
# *(nice to use with debugger if you set ARGS in .env file)
ARGS="eltrod relay -f torrc.relay.dev -pw password1234_" cargo run
ARGS="eltrod client -f torrc.client.dev -pw password1234_" cargo run
```

Release (ci)
=============
To create a new release:

**For Linux and Windows x86:**
```sh
# Create and push a release tag (triggers GitHub Actions build)
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0

# Or for pre-release versions
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0-beta
```

The release script will:
1. Update the version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Create a git tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
3. Push the tag to GitHub
4. Trigger GitHub Actions to build binaries and create a release

**For Arm:**

Github actions is slow for arm builds, so its recommended to build locally on a arm computer like a Macbook M-Series. 
You can run this script to kick off the build locally using Github "act". See for install instructions: https://nektosact.com/
1. Install Prereqs
  ```
  #nix
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
  docker buildx create --name mybuilder --driver docker-container --use 
  docker buildx inspect --bootstrap 
  docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
  # if you use orbstack and get errors you might need to turn off (or on?) rosetta 
  orb config set rosetta false

  brew install act
  docker info | grep Architecture
  ```

2. Create ./secrets
  ```
  GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_yourtokenhere
  ```
3. Run a actions build locally
```
./scripts/build-arm.sh
# or

# for mac arm
ACT=true act workflow_dispatch --secret-file .secrets -j build-mac-arm -P self-hosted=-self-hosted

# for linux arm
ACT=true act workflow_dispatch --secret-file .secrets -j build-linux-arm -P self-hosted=-self-hosted
```


.env
```sh
PHOENIXD_URL=http://localhost:9740
PHOENIXD_PASSWORD={{YOUR_PW}}
PHOENIXD_TEST_PAYMENT_HASH={{{{YOUR_TEST_PAYMENT_HASH}}}} 
PAYMENT_INTERVAL_ROUNDS=10 # Not being used, need to think more about this, hardcode to 10 now so we can pass in 10 payment id hashed during circuit build
```
dev
```sh
ARGS="eltord client -f torrc.client.dev -pw password1234_"
```


torrc
======
`torrc.relay.dev`
```sh
# see the torrc sample file this project
```

`torrc.client.dev`
```sh
# same as the torrc sample file but minus theses settings
- OrPort
- PaymentBolt12Offer
- ExitRelay
```


TODO
====
1. simply read the payments-sent.json in as the same dir as the TOR DataDirectory
2. simplify the default command:
```
# from
./eltor client -f torrc -pw password1234_
# to 
./eltor
```
3. Should the same binary run both the client and relay? like always run client, but also run relay if bolt12 is configured?
4. rotate the payments-sent.json file after a few thousand rows
